Kalito-Space is designed to be the family's AI hub that helps manage medications, appointments, vital signs, and healthcare providers while having conversations with context-aware AI personas.
The  Family Hub

Think of this as your family's digital filing cabinet:

Patient Profiles: Store everything about each person you care for. Their demographics, emergency contacts, insurance information, primary doctor, medications, appointments, and health measurements. Each patient becomes a complete record you can access instantly.

Medication Management: Track every medication with brand and generic names, dosages, frequencies, prescribing doctors, pharmacies, and even side effects to watch for. 

Appointment Tracking: Keep all doctor visits organized with appointment types (routine checkup, follow-up, specialist visit, emergency), preparation notes (what to bring, questions to ask), and outcome summaries after the visit. Link appointments to specific healthcare providers and track follow-up requirements.

Health Measurements: Log weight and blood glucose readings over time. See trends, identify patterns, and have concrete data ready when doctors ask "How has his blood sugar been?"

Healthcare Provider Directory: Maintain a complete list of doctors, and clinics with all their contact information, specialties, and notes about preferences or important details.

Professional Reports: Generate printable patient reports with comprehensive information including demographics, current medications, upcoming appointments, and emergency contacts. Perfect for sharing with healthcare providers, caregivers, family members, or keeping physical records.

Closing Thoughts

KalitoSpace is currently used as a PWA, but recently i was able to turn it into an .apk android app, with the backend server running on my kubuntu laptop. I'm interested to hear what you folks think. Any ideas, tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
