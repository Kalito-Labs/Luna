## 1. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)

### Core Theory
CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. Negative thought patterns lead to negative emotions and unhelpful behaviors. By identifying and challenging these patterns, we can change how we feel and act.

**The CBT Triangle:**
```
   Thoughts
    /    \
   /      \
Feelings - Behaviors
```

### Key Concepts

#### Automatic Thoughts
- Immediate, reflexive thoughts that pop up in response to situations
- Often negative, distorted, or unhelpful
- Usually happen so fast we don't notice them

**Example:** Someone doesn't text back → "They hate me" (automatic thought)

#### Cognitive Distortions
Common thinking errors that maintain negative patterns:

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: Seeing things in black and white
   - "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure"

2. **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst possible outcome
   - "If I mess up this presentation, I'll lose my job and become homeless"

3. **Overgeneralization**: One event means everything is always that way
   - "I failed once, so I always fail"

4. **Mental Filter**: Focusing only on negatives, ignoring positives
   - Getting 9/10 positive reviews but only thinking about the 1 negative

5. **Mind Reading**: Assuming you know what others think
   - "They think I'm stupid" (without evidence)

6. **Fortune Telling**: Predicting negative outcomes
   - "I know this won't work out"

7. **Emotional Reasoning**: "I feel it, so it must be true"
   - "I feel worthless, therefore I am worthless"

8. **Should Statements**: Rigid rules about how things "should" be
   - "I should be better at this by now"

9. **Labeling**: Defining yourself by one trait or mistake
   - "I'm a loser" instead of "I made a mistake"

10. **Personalization**: Blaming yourself for things outside your control
    - "It's my fault they're upset"

#### Thought Records
A structured way to examine and challenge thoughts:

1. **Situation**: What happened?
2. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
3. **Emotion**: What did you feel? How intense (0-100)?
4. **Evidence For**: What supports this thought?
5. **Evidence Against**: What contradicts this thought?
6. **Alternative Thought**: What's a more balanced perspective?
7. **New Emotion**: How do you feel now? Intensity?

### CBT Techniques

#### 1. Cognitive Restructuring
- Identify the distorted thought
- Examine the evidence
- Generate alternative interpretations
- Choose a more balanced thought

**Kalito's Role:**
- "I notice you said [distorted thought]. What evidence do you have for that?"
- "What would you tell a friend who had that thought?"
- "What's another way to look at this situation?"

#### 2. Behavioral Activation
When depressed, we withdraw → which makes depression worse. Behavioral activation breaks this cycle by scheduling positive activities.

**Steps:**
1. Identify activities that bring pleasure or accomplishment
2. Schedule them (even when you don't feel like it)
3. Track completion and mood impact
4. Gradually increase activities

#### 3. Behavioral Experiments
Test whether your fears/beliefs are actually true.

**Example:**
- Belief: "If I go to the party, I'll have a panic attack and embarrass myself"
- Experiment: Go to the party for 30 minutes
- Result: Discover anxiety decreases, or that you can handle it

#### 4. Graded Exposure
For anxiety/phobias - gradually face feared situations in a hierarchy from least to most scary.

#### 5. Problem-Solving
Structured approach to challenges:
1. Define the problem clearly
2. Brainstorm solutions (no judgment)
3. Evaluate pros/cons of each
4. Choose one and try it
5. Evaluate the outcome
