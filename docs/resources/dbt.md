## 2. DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)

### Core Theory
DBT combines acceptance (you're doing your best) with change (you need to learn new skills).
**The Dialectic:** Accepting yourself as you are WHILE working to change.

### The Four Modules

---

### Module 1: Mindfulness (The Foundation)

**What it is:** Being fully present in the current moment without judgment.

**Core Skills:**

#### Observe
- Notice without describing or labeling
- Watch thoughts/emotions/sensations come and go
- Like sitting by a river, watching leaves float by

#### Describe
- Put words to what you observe
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- "I notice tightness in my chest"
- Facts only, no judgments

#### Participate
- Fully engage in the current activity
- Lose self-consciousness
- Be one with the experience

#### Non-Judgmental Stance
- Stop labeling things as "good" or "bad"
- Replace judgments with descriptions
- Notice when you judge, then return to observing

#### One-Mindfully
- Do one thing at a time with full attention
- When your mind wanders, gently return
- No multitasking

#### Effectively
- Focus on what works, not what's "fair"
- Do what's needed in this situation
- Let go of "should" and "right/wrong"

**Mindfulness Exercises:**
- Body scan
- Breath counting
- Five senses grounding (5 things you see, 4 hear, 3 touch, 2 smell, 1 taste)
- Walking meditation
- Eating meditation

### Module 2: Distress Tolerance

**What it is:** Skills to survive crises without making things worse.

**When to use:** When emotions are so intense that problem-solving isn't possible yet.

#### STOP Skill (Crisis Response)
- **S**top: Freeze, don't react immediately
- **T**ake a step back: Get space from the situation
- **O**bserve: Notice what's happening inside and outside
- **P**roceed mindfully: Choose wise action

#### TIP Skill (Emergency Emotion Regulation)
- **T**emperature: Change your body temperature (ice on face, cold shower)
- **I**ntense exercise: Burn off adrenaline (run, jump, push-ups)
- **P**aced breathing: Slow exhales longer than inhales

#### ACCEPTS (Distraction)
- **A**ctivities: Engage in something absorbing
- **C**ontributing: Help someone else
- **C**omparisons: Compare to times you've coped worse or others' struggles
- **E**motions: Do something that creates opposite emotion (comedy for sadness)
- **P**ushing away: Mentally shelve the problem for now
- **T**houghts: Engage your mind (puzzles, count backwards)
- **S**ensations: Strong sensations (hold ice, squeeze stress ball, loud music)

#### IMPROVE (Make the Moment Better)
- **I**magery: Visualize peaceful scene or coping effectively
- **M**eaning: Find purpose in the suffering
- **P**rayer: Connect to something greater (spiritual or not)
- **R**elaxation: Progressive muscle relaxation, breathing
- **O**ne thing in the moment: Focus on present, not past/future
- **V**acation: Brief mental or physical break
- **E**ncouragement: Self-affirmations, cheerleading

#### Radical Acceptance
- Accepting reality as it is (not approving, just acknowledging)
- Suffering = Pain × Resistance
- When you stop fighting reality, you can respond effectively
- "It is what it is"

#### Willingness vs. Willfulness
- **Willingness**: Doing what's needed, even if hard
- **Willfulness**: Refusing to accept, trying to control what you can't
