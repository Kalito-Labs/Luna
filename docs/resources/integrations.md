7. **Understand** why (CBT, emotion regulation)
8. **Accept** what can't be changed (ACT, radical acceptance)
9. **Regulate** overwhelming states (somatic, DBT distress tolerance)
10. **Navigate** relationships (DBT interpersonal effectiveness)
11. **Live meaningfully** (ACT values and committed action)
12. **Build resilience** (all of the above)
