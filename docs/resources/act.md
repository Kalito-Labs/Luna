### ## 3. ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)

### Core Theory
ACT focuses on psychological flexibility: being present, accepting what's out of your control, and committing to actions aligned with your values.

**ACT's Goal:** Not to eliminate difficult emotions, but to live a meaningful life despite them.

### The Six Core Processes

---

### 1. Cognitive Defusion

**The Problem:** Fusion with thoughts - treating thoughts as literal truth, commands, or threats.

**Examples of Fusion:**
- "I'm having the thought 'I'm worthless'" becomes "I AM worthless"
- Believing thoughts = facts
- Obeying thought commands ("Don't go to the party")
- Fighting with thoughts (trying to suppress them)

**The Solution:** Create distance between you and your thoughts.

**Defusion Techniques:**

#### "I'm having the thought that..."
- Transform: "I'm stupid" → "I'm having the thought that I'm stupid"
- Creates observer perspective

#### Name the Story
- "Ah, there's the 'I'm not good enough' story again"
- Recognize repetitive thought patterns

#### Thank Your Mind
- "Thanks mind, I know you're trying to protect me"
- Acknowledge without obeying

#### Silly Voices
- Say the thought in a cartoon character voice
- Sing it to "Happy Birthday"
- Makes the thought lose its power

#### Leaves on a Stream
- Visualize thoughts as leaves floating down a stream
- Watch them drift by without grabbing them

#### Thoughts as Text
- Imagine the thought written on a sign, or scrolling on a screen
- See the thought as an object, not truth

### 2. Acceptance

**The Problem:** Experiential avoidance - trying to escape or control uncomfortable thoughts/feelings.

**The Paradox:** The more you struggle against pain, the more it persists.
- "Don't think about pink elephants" → You think about pink elephants

**The Solution:** Make room for discomfort without struggle.

**Acceptance ≠ Resignation**
- Not giving up or liking the pain
- Choosing to feel it rather than fight it
- Creates energy for valued action

**Acceptance Techniques:**

#### Expansion
- Notice where the feeling is in your body
- Breathe into it
- Make space for it, let it be

#### Urge Surfing
- Treat cravings/urges like ocean waves
- They rise, peak, and fall naturally
- You don't have to act on them

#### Willingness
- Ask: "Am I willing to feel this in service of what matters?"
- Open hands gesture (vs. clenched fists of control)

---

### 3. Contact with Present Moment (Mindfulness)

**The Problem:** Living in past (rumination) or future (worry), missing your life NOW.

**The Solution:** Flexible attention to here-and-now experience.

**Present Moment Practices:**
- Five senses grounding
- Notice thoughts coming and going
- Describe your environment
- "What am I experiencing right now?"
## 4. Mindfulness

### Core Theory
Mindfulness is paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgment (Jon Kabat-Zinn). It's the foundation of many therapeutic approaches.

**Two Components:**
1. **Attention regulation**: Training focus on present
2. **Attitude**: Approaching experience with curiosity, openness, acceptance

### Key Concepts

#### Automatic Pilot vs. Mindful Awareness
- **Automatic**: Going through motions, lost in thought
- **Mindful**: Fully present, aware of experience

#### Beginner's Mind
- Experiencing each moment as if for the first time
- Dropping assumptions and expectations
- Curious about the ordinary

#### Non-Judgment
- Observing without labeling as good/bad
- Noticing judgments, then returning to observing
- Acceptance of what is

#### Non-Striving
- Being, not doing
- Not trying to achieve or fix
- Allowing experience to unfold

### Types of Mindfulness Practice

---

### Formal Practice (Dedicated Time)

#### 1. Breath Awareness
**How:**
- Sit comfortably
- Focus attention on breath (nose, chest, belly)
- When mind wanders (it will), gently return to breath
- No judgment when you notice wandering

**Duration:** 5-20 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Trains attention
- Calms nervous system
- Creates mental space

#### 2. Body Scan
**How:**
- Lie down or sit
- Systematically move attention through body parts
- Notice sensations without changing them
- Breathe into areas of tension

**Route:** Toes → feet → legs → hips → belly → chest → arms → hands → neck → face → head

**Duration:** 10-45 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Body awareness
- Releases tension
- Grounds in present

#### 3. Sitting Meditation
**How:**
- Start with breath as anchor
- Expand to sounds, sensations, thoughts
- Notice everything that arises
- Keep returning to present when lost in thought

**Duration:** 10-60 minutes

#### 4. Walking Meditation
**How:**
- Walk slowly and deliberately
- Notice lifting, moving, placing each foot
- Feel sensations in legs, feet, body
- If mind wanders, return to walking

**Pace:** Very slow to normal walking speed

**Benefits:**
- Mindfulness in motion
- Good for restlessness
- Portable practice

#### 5. Loving-Kindness (Metta)
**How:**
- Generate feelings of warmth/kindness
- Direct toward: yourself → loved one → neutral person → difficult person → all beings

**Duration:** 10-30 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Cultivates compassion
- Reduces self-criticism

### Informal Practice (Everyday Mindfulness)

#### Mindful Eating
- Eat without screens/distractions
- Notice colors, textures, smells
- Chew slowly, taste fully
- Awareness of hunger/fullness

#### Mindful Listening
- Full attention on speaker
- Notice urge to interrupt or plan response
- Listen to understand, not reply

#### Mindful Showering
- Feel water temperature, pressure
- Notice soap texture, scent
- Sensations of drying off

#### Mindful Walking
- Feel feet on ground
- Notice body movement
- Observe surroundings

#### STOP Practice
Throughout day, pause to:
- **S**top
- **T**ake a breath
- **O**bserve (thoughts, feelings, sensations)
- **P**roceed

### Common Challenges

#### "My mind won't stop thinking"
- That's normal! Mind's job is to think
- Goal isn't blank mind, it's noticing thoughts
- Each time you notice wandering = success, not failure

#### "I'm doing it wrong"
- No wrong way to be present
- Whatever arises IS the practice
- Judgment about practice is just another thought to notice

#### "I don't have time"
- Start with 2 minutes
- Informal practice counts
- It's not extra task, it's how you do existing tasks

#### "It's not working"
- Not about feeling different immediately
- Benefits are cumulative and subtle
- Practicing regularly is "working"

4. Self-as-Context (Observer Self / Sky as Context)

**The Problem:** Over-identification with thoughts, feelings, roles, labels.
- "I AM my anxiety"
- "I AM a failure"

**The Metaphor: Sky as Context**

Imagine your consciousness as the sky:
- **Thoughts/Emotions** = Weather (clouds, storms, sunshine)
- **Observing Self** = The sky itself

Key insights:
- The sky contains all weather but isn't damaged by it
- Storms pass, clouds move, but sky remains constant
- You can observe "I'm experiencing anxiety" from the still point of the observer

**The Observer Self:**
- The "you" that has always been there
- The continuous awareness watching your life
- Not your thoughts, emotions, body, or roles
- The context that holds all experiences

**Exercises:**

#### Observer Meditation
- Notice you're noticing thoughts
- Who is the one observing?
- You are not the content, you are the space

#### Continuous You
- Remember being 5 years old → teenager → now
- Your experiences changed, but "you" were always there
- That continuous awareness is observer self

#### "I am not my..."
- I am not my thoughts (they come and go, I remain)
- I am not my emotions (they pass, I'm still here)
- I am not my body (it changes, I observe it)
- I am not my roles (I have many, but I'm the observer)

### 5. Values

**The Problem:** Living on autopilot, driven by fear or others' expectations.

**The Solution:** Clarify what truly matters to you, then orient life toward it.

**Values vs. Goals:**
- **Goal**: Lose 20 pounds (achievable, then done)
- **Value**: Health, vitality (ongoing direction)
- Goals serve values

**Life Domains:**
1. Relationships (family, romantic, friendships)
2. Work/Career
3. Education/Personal Growth
4. Recreation/Leisure
5. Spirituality
6. Community/Citizenship
7. Health/Physical Well-being
8. Environment/Nature

**Values Clarification Questions:**
- What do you want your life to stand for?
- At your funeral, what do you want said about you?
- When you're 90, what will you be glad you did?
- What would you do if fear wasn't a factor?
- What makes you feel alive?

**Values Bullseye:**
- Identify key values
- Rate how consistently you live them (0-10)
- Identify specific actions that align

### 6. Committed Action

**The Problem:** Knowing your values but not acting on them.

**The Solution:** Take concrete steps toward valued life, even when uncomfortable.

**SMART Goals:**
- **S**pecific: Clearly defined
- **M**easurable: Can track progress
- **A**chievable: Realistic
- **R**elevant: Connects to values
- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline

**Barriers to Action:**
- Fusion with "I can't" thoughts
- Avoidance of discomfort
- Lack of skills
- Overwhelm

**Committed Action Process:**
1. Choose a value domain
2. Identify a specific value
3. Set a goal aligned with that value
4. Break into tiny steps
5. Commit to first step
6. Notice barriers (thoughts/feelings)
7. Use defusion/acceptance to make room
8. Take action anyway
9. Reflect and adjust

**Willingness:**
- "I'm willing to feel anxious to connect with others" (social value)
- "I'm willing to feel frustrated to learn this skill" (growth value)
